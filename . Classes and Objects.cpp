. Classes and Objects
Classes are blueprints for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    string brand;
    string model;
    int year;

    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Model: " << model << ", Year: " << year << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar; // Creating an object of Car
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.model = "Corolla";
    myCar.year = 2020;
    myCar.displayInfo(); // Output: Brand: Toyota, Model: Corolla, Year: 2020
    return 0;
}
2. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance; // private variable

public:
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    double getBalance() { // public method to access private data
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount myAccount(1000);
    myAccount.deposit(500);
    cout << "Balance: $" << myAccount.getBalance() << endl; // Output: Balance: $1500
    return 0;
}
3. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a new class to inherit properties and methods from an existing class. This promotes code reusability.
Example:
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() {
        cout << "Honk!" << endl;
    }
};

class Car : public Vehicle { // Car inherits from Vehicle
public:
    void displayType() {
        cout << "I am a car." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.honk(); // Inherited method
    myCar.displayType(); // Output: I am a car.
    return 0;
}
4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through function overloading and function overriding.
a) Function Overloading
Same function name, different parameters.
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) { // Overloaded function
        return a + b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Math math;
    cout << "Integer sum: " << math.add(5, 10) << endl; // Output: 15
    cout << "Double sum: " << math.add(5.5, 10.2) << endl; // Output: 15.7
    return 0;
}
b) Function Overriding
A derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() { // Base class method
        cout << "Animal makes a sound." << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override { // Overridden method
        cout << "Dog barks." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* myDog = new Dog(); // Pointer of base class type
    myDog->sound(); // Output: Dog barks.
    delete myDog;
    return 0;
}
5. Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
It can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.
Example of Abstraction using Abstract Classes
cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle." << endl;
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Square." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle();
    Shape* shape2 = new Square();
    
    shape1->draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle.
    shape2->draw(); // Output: Drawing Square.
    
    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;
    return 0;
}
Summary of OOP Concepts:
Classes and Objects: Fundamental building blocks of OOP.
Encapsulation: Hides data and methods to protect them from outside interference.
Inheritance: Allows classes to derive properties from other classes.
Polymorphism: Enables methods to have multiple forms.
Abstraction: Hides complex details and exposes only necessary parts of an object.
These concepts work together to promote better organization, modularity, and reusability of code in C++. Let me know if you need further explanations or examples!

To permanently fix the tabs in Microsoft Edge so that they don't disappear or change when you reopen the browser, follow these steps:

Method 1: Set Startup Settings
Open Microsoft Edge.
Click on the three dots (ellipsis) in the upper right corner to open the menu.
Select "Settings" from the drop-down menu.
In the left sidebar, click on "On startup".
Choose "Open a specific page or pages".
Click on "Add a new page".
Enter the URL of the page you want to keep open, then click "Add".
Repeat for any additional tabs you want to set as startup tabs.
Method 2: Use Collections
If you want to keep your tabs organized and easily accessible:

Open Microsoft Edge.
Click on the Collections icon (it looks like a book) on the right side of the address bar.
Click on "Start new collection".
Name your collection.
Drag and drop your tabs into the collection, or right-click on a tab and select "Add to collection".
You can access this collection later to restore your tabs.
Method 3: Use a Session Manager Extension
You can use a session manager extension to save your tabs and restore them later. Here’s how:

Open Microsoft Edge.
Go to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store.
Search for session manager extensions (like "Session Buddy").
Click on "Get" to install the extension.
Follow the extension's instructions to save your current tabs.
Method 4: Enable "Continue where you left off"
This will allow Edge to remember your open tabs after closing:

Open Microsoft Edge.
Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select "Settings".
In the left sidebar, click on "On startup".
Choose "Continue where you left off".
Notes:
Remember to regularly save your work or bookmarks if you have important tabs.
Some methods may require additional permissions, so ensure your settings allow them.
By using these methods, you should be able to keep your tabs permanently fixed in Microsoft Edge. Let me know if you need more help!






















=>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>**********************>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>n Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++, the four main pillars are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. Here's a concise definition and example for each pillar that you can use for interviews:

1. Encapsulation
Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, usually a class. It restricts direct access to some components, which can help prevent unintended interference and misuse.

Example:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance; // Private variable

public:
    BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        balance = initialBalance;
    }

    void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }

    double getBalance() { // Public method to access private data
        return balance;
    }
};

int main() {
    BankAccount myAccount(1000);
    myAccount.deposit(500);
    cout << "Balance: $" << myAccount.getBalance() << endl; // Output: Balance: $1500
    return 0;
}
2. Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.

Example:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle." << endl;
    }
};

class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Square." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape1 = new Circle();
    Shape* shape2 = new Square();
    
    shape1->draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle.
    shape2->draw(); // Output: Drawing Square.
    
    delete shape1;
    delete shape2;
    return 0;
}
3. Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance allows a new class (derived class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

Example:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    void eat() {
        cout << "Eating..." << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal { // Dog inherits from Animal
public:
    void bark() {
        cout << "Barking..." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Dog myDog;
    myDog.eat(); // Inherited method
    myDog.bark(); // Output: Barking...
    return 0;
}
4. Polymorphism
Definition: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. It can be achieved through function overloading and function overriding.

Example of Function Overriding:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { // Base class method
        cout << "Base class show function called." << endl;
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { // Overridden method
        cout << "Derived class show function called." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Base* b;           // Base class pointer
    Derived d;        // Derived class object
    b = &d;           // Pointing to derived class object

    b->show(); // Output: Derived class show function called.
    return 0;
}
Summary of OOP Pillars
Encapsulation: Protects data by restricting access to it.
Abstraction: Hides complexity and shows only the necessary features.
Inheritance: Enables code reuse through class hierarchies.
Polymorphism: Allows for method overriding and overloading, enabling flexibility in code.
Interview Tips:
Be ready to explain each concept in your own words.
Understand the differences and how they work together.
Use real-world analogies (e.g., a car as a class with properties like color and methods like drive).
Practice coding examples to show familiarity with each concept.
