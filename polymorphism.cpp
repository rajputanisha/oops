/***
 * word “polymorphism” means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism is a person who at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person exhibits different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered one of the important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
 * /**********
 * polymorphism allows for flexibility and the ability to define methods in a base class and override them in derived classes. This leads to code that is easier to maintain and extend. By using polymorphism, you can write code that works on the superclass level, which can handle objects of derived classes through a common interface.
 * maintian of code is easy it also increase readanilty ans reusabilty */
